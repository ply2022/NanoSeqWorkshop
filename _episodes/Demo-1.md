## Library preparation 

In this workshop, we will introduce you the [Ligation Sequecning Kit](https://store.nanoporetech.com/us/ligation-sequencing-kit110.html){: target="_blank"}, which is a genome sequencing kit. We are going to use the protocol [Ligation sequencing gDNA (SQK-LSK110)](https://community.nanoporetech.com/docs/prepare/library_prep_protocols/genomic-dna-by-ligation-sqk-lsk110/v/gde_9108_v110_revv_10nov2020){: target="_blank"}.
In the community, you can review the process in detail. Due to the time and equipemnts limitation. We **will not** perform actual library preparation process. We will focus on the flow cell loading and setting the MinKonw software.

### Genomic DNA quality and quantity

### Ligation sequencing gDNA (SQK-LSK110)  


## Genomic DNA sequencing on the MinION sequencer
 
### Anatomy of the flow cell

### Performing flow cell check 

### Priming and loding the flow cell

Please review this video for demonstration:

> ## Loading the flow cell
>**DO NOT** pipette while you priming or loading the flowcell. Flow cell is very >sensitive to pipetting. Pipetting might lead to pore loss.
