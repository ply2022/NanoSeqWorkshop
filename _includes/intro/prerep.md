**Requirements:**
Participants must bring a personal computer with Windows, MacOS or Linux operating system 
(not a tablet, Chromebook, etc.) that they have administrative privileges on. 
We will provide a temporary account with access to the University of Florida Hipergator High performance computing cluster so that attendees may work more easily with their files. Files will be available during the APS meeting. Attendees are expected to be familiar with basic laboratory techniques such as pipetting liquids using a micropipette and general lab safety.
