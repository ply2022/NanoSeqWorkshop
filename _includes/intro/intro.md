{: #intro}
Plant Pathologists who are interested in utilizing third-generation sequencing to: study plant or pathogen genome structure and function, aid with plant disease diagnosis or emerging infectious diseases, and general microbiome analysis.

Participants will be led through a hands-on workshop to gain experience with third-generation sequencing using a nanopore sequencer. Using samples we provide, attendees will be guided through the processes of library preparation, flow cell loading, sequencing, data processing and analysis. Participants will learn how changes in DNA yield, purity, and integrity impact nanopore sequencing. Bioinformatic pipelines for base calling, quality control and genome assembly will be shared with participants. We believe that attendees will benefit from this **introductory level** course, and it will allow researchers to apply this tool to their specific interests, such as targeted sequencing, generating full-length transcripts, and metagenomic applications.
