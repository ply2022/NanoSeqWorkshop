**Requirements:**
**Participants must bring a personal computer** with Windows, MacOS or Linux operating system (not a tablet, Chromebook, etc.) that they have administrative privileges on. They should have a few specific software packages listed [here](/setup.html) installed on their computer. 
All the workshop materials can be found in the public respiratory. Participants can review the materials and follow the instructions to install the software (**highly recommended**) that is required for sequencing and data processing. Attendees will be able to submit new issues in the public respiratory, so all the attendees can contribute to the discussions.
