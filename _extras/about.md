### Pei-Ling Yu

Pei-Ling is a Postocotral Associate at University of Florida in the Department of Plant Pathology. Her research focuses on developing a diagnostic tool for phytopathogenic fungi. She is recenttly working on designing bioinformatic pipelines of rapid pathogen identification and evaluating slash pine seedlings for disease tolerance against pitch canker causing agents *Fusarium circinatum*

### Jeremy T. Brawner

Jeremy is an Assistant Professor in the Plant Pathology Department at University of Florida. He joined the faculty of the UF Department of Plant Pathology in 2019, with responsibilities in research and extension on Tree Health Genetic Resources. His research program is focused on developing disease tolerant tree crops and his extension program delivers these varieties to a range of stakeholders. He works with forest and tree crop managers in Florida, the US, and abroad to develop more efficient disease screening and breeding programs.

### Kacie Quello

Kacie is a Discovery Pathology Specialist Sr at Bayer Crop Science. She received her Master's in plant pathology at Purdue working on apple scab and brown rot of stone fruit. In recent years, she has worked with diseases on broccoli, lettuce and spinach. The pathogens include oomycetes, bacteria, and fungi. In addition, she has created primers and used published primers to detect specific RNA virus and tomato.

### Joshua L. Konkol

Josh is a graduate research assistant in the Plant Pathology Department working in Dr. Jeremy Brawner’s Forestry Genetics laboratory and Dr. Jeff Rollins’s Molecular Fungal Pathology laboratory. He is interested in the host-pathogen interactions of vascular wilt diseases and the development of plants with tolerance to these pathogens. Currently I am investigating the colonization and host responses to Raffaelea lauricola, the causal agent of laurel wilt disease that affects North American Lauracea, including avocado trees and several important forest species.
